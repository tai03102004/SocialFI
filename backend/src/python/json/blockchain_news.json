  "market_outlook": "The market outlook for Bitcoin in the short to medium term is mixed. Institutional adoption and regulatory clarity provide a strong foundation for long-term growth.

Algorithmic trading and AI-driven strategies introduce new volatility patterns. The mining industry's consolidation and the impact of macroeconomic factors like interest rates and inflation will also influence price movements. The long-term outlook remains positive due to the increasing institutional interest, technological advancements, and the potential for Bitcoin to become a foundational component of the global financial system, but with increased volatility.",
